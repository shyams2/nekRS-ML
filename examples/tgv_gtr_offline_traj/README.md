# Offline training of a time dependent Graph Transformer surrogate model

This example demonstrates how the `gnn` and the `trajGen` plugins can be used to create a distributed graph from the nekRS mesh and train a Graph Transformer surrogate from a saved solution trajectory.
It is based off of the [Taylor-Green-Vortex flow](../tgv/README.md), however on a slightly larger mesh, and it is a copy of the [tgv_gnn_offline_traj](../tgv_gnn_offline_traj/README.md) example, but with the transformer based model instead of the message passing one.
In this example, the model takes as inputs the three components of velocity at a particular time step and learns to predict the velocity components at every graph (mesh) node at a later time step.
It is a time dependent modeling task, since the training data consists of a pair of solution fields and the model learns to predict future solutions.

Specifically, in `UDF_Setup()`, the `graph` class is instantiated from the mesh, followed by calls to `graph->gnnSetup();` and `graph->gnnWrite();` to setup and write the model input files to disk, respectively.
The graph transformer input files are written in a directory called `./gnn_outputs_poly_7`, where the `7` marks the fact that 7th order polynomials are used in this case.
The `trajGen` class is also instantiated, followed by a call to `tgen->trajGenSetup()`.
When initializing the trajectory class, note the definition of `dt_factor`.
This is the delta factor used to create the trajectory for training.
If `dt_factor=1`, the model learns to predict 1 time step into the future, i.e., the next nekRS time step.
If `dt_factor=10`, the model learns to predict the 10 time steps into the future.
In `UDF_ExecuteStep()`, `tgen->trajGenWrite()` is called to write the trajectory files to disk.
The files are written to `./traj_poly_7`, under a sub-directory tagged with the initial time and the delta factor used for the trajectory, as well as separated into directories for each MPI rank of the nekRS simulation.


## Building nekRS

Requirements:
* Linux, Mac OS X (Microsoft WSL and Windows is not supported)
* GNU/oneAPI/NVHPC/ROCm compilers (C++17/C99 compatible)
* MPI-3.1 or later
* CMake version 3.21 or later
* PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric

To build nekRS and the required dependencies, first clone our GitHub repository:

```sh
https://github.com/argonne-lcf/nekRS-ML.git
```

Then, simply execute one of the build scripts contained in the repository.
The HPC systems currently supported are:
* [Polaris](https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/polaris/) (Argonne LCF)
* [Aurora](https://docs.alcf.anl.gov/aurora/) (Argonne LCF)

For example, to build nekRS-ML on Aurora, execute from a compute node

```sh
./BuildMeOnAurora
```

## Running the example

Scripts are provided to conveniently generate run scripts and config files for the workflow on the different ALCF systems.
Note that a virtual environment with PyTorch Geometric is needed to train the graph transformer model.

**From a compute node** execute:
```sh
./gen_run_script <system_name> </path/to/nekRS>
```
or
```sh
./gen_run_script <system_name> </path/to/nekRS> --venv_path </path/to/venv>
```
if you have the necessary packages already installed in a Python virtual environment. For more information
on how to use `gen_run_script`, use `--help`

```sh
./gen_run_script --help
```

The script will produce a `run.sh` script specifically tailored to the desired system and using the desired nekRS install directory.

Finally, simply execute the run script **from the compute nodes** with

```bash
./run.sh
```

The `run.sh` script is composed of five steps:

- The nekRS simulation to generate the graph transformer input files and the trajectory. This step produces the graph and training data in `./gnn_outputs_poly_7` and `./traj_poly_7`, respectively.
- An auxiliary Python script to create additional data structures needed to enforce consistency in the model. This step produces some additional files in `./gnn_outputs_poly_7` needed during training.
- A Python script to check the accuracy of the graph data generated. This script compares the results in `./ref` with those created in `./gnn_outputs_poly_7`.
- A second check with the same Python script to ensure the accuracy of the trajectory data generated. This script compares the results in `./ref` with those created in `./traj_poly_7`.
- Model training. This step trains the graph transformer for 100 iterations based on the data provided in `./gnn_outputs_poly_7` and `./traj_poly_7`.
- The case is run with 4 MPI ranks for simplicity, however the users can set the desired number of ranks. Note to comment out the accuracy checks as they will fail in this case.
